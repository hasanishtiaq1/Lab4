Implementing basic Webserver

In this we implemented basic webserver that perform POST GET and HEAD methods.  The server runs on port 10000. Fork () is used to handle requests. The respond () function handle all the functionalities of GET POST and HEAD methods. To run the program first run the server.c file then run your browser and type 127.0.0.1:10000/nameOfYourFile. If you will not specify the name of file it will use index.html as default (if it exists). Otherwise it will through the error 404 file not found.
